## A/B Hypothesis Testing: Ad campaign performance 

# Business objective  


An advertising company is running an online ad for a client with the intention of increasing brand awareness. The advertiser company earns money by charging the client based on user engagements with the ad it designed and serves via different platforms. To increase its market competitiveness, the advertising company provides a further service that quantifies the increase in brand awareness as a result of the ads it shows to online users. The main objective of this project is to test if the ads that the advertising company runs resulted in a significant lift in brand awareness. 

# Project Overview
SmartAd is a mobile first advertiser agency. It designs intuitive touch-enabled advertising. It provides brands with an automated advertising experience via machine learning and creative excellence. Their company is based on the principle of voluntary participation which is proven to increase brand engagement and memorability 10 x more than static alternatives. 
SmartAd provides an additional service called Brand Impact Optimiser (BIO), a lightweight questionnaire, served with every campaign to determine the impact of the creative, the ad they design, on various upper funnel metrics, including memorability and brand sentiment. 
As a Machine learning engineer in SmartAd, one of your tasks is to design a reliable hypothesis testing algorithm for the BIO service and to determine whether a recent advertising campaign resulted in a significant lift in brand awareness.

Data
The BIO data for this project is a “Yes” and “No” response of online users to the following question


Q: Do you know the brand Lux?
		O  Yes
		O  No

This is a test run and the main objective is to validate the hypothesis algorithm you built. SmartAd ran this campaign from 3-10 July 2020. The users that were presented with the questionnaire above were chosen according to the following rule:

Control: users who have been shown a dummy ad
Exposed: users who have been shown a creative (ad) that was designed by SmartAd for the client. 


The data is available for download here.

The data collected for this challenge has the following columns
auction_id: the unique id of the online user who has been presented the BIO. In standard terminologies this is called an impression id. The user may see the BIO questionnaire but choose not to respond. In that case both the yes and no columns are zero.
experiment: which group the user belongs to - control or exposed.
date: the date in YYYY-MM-DD format
hour: the hour of the day in HH format.
device_make: the name of the type of device the user has e.g. Samsung
platform_os: the id of the OS the user has. 
browser: the name of the browser the user uses to see the BIO questionnaire.
yes: 1 if the user chooses the “Yes” radio button for the BIO questionnaire.
no: 1 if the user chooses the “No” radio button for the BIO questionnaire.
